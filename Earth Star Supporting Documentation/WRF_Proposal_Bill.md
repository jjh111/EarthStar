# WASTE RECLAMATION FUND ACT OF 2025

## Short Title
This Act may be cited as the "Waste Reclamation Fund Act of 2025."

## Findings and Purpose

### Section 1: Congressional Findings

Congress finds that:

(1) The United States generates over 292 million tons of municipal solid waste annually, with significant portions consisting of non-recyclable materials that persist in the environment for decades or centuries.

(2) Current waste management systems externalize the true costs of waste disposal, placing financial and environmental burdens on municipalities, taxpayers, and future generations rather than on the producers of waste-generating products.

(3) Microplastics and other persistent pollutants have been detected in human bloodstreams, drinking water, soil, and ecosystems at every scale, creating public health and environmental crises.

(4) Manufacturers currently lack sufficient economic incentive to design products for durability, repairability, and end-of-life reclamation.

(5) Indigenous stewardship practices, including those practiced by California tribal nations for over 10,000 years, demonstrate proven methods of resource management based on reciprocity, regeneration, and multi-generational thinking.

(6) Creating pathways for waste transformation and ecosystem restoration can generate meaningful employment while addressing environmental degradation.

(7) The principle that those who profit from waste-generating products should bear responsibility for the full lifecycle costs of those products aligns with fundamental principles of economic justice and environmental stewardship.

### Section 2: Purpose

The purposes of this Act are to:

(1) Establish a dedicated funding mechanism to address the waste crisis through research, conservation, and workforce development.

(2) Internalize the costs of waste disposal and environmental remediation into the pricing of consumer goods.

(3) Incentivize manufacturers to design products with durability, repairability, and end-of-life reclamation as primary considerations.

(4) Create a new category of employment: Earth Stewards, tasked with waste transformation, ecosystem restoration, and transitioning communities toward regenerative practices.

(5) Fund research into waste reclamation technologies, circular economy systems, and regenerative practices.

(6) Penalize planned obsolescence and deceptive product design practices.

(7) Reduce dependence on imported materials by maximizing utilization of existing waste streams.

## Title I: Establishment of the Waste Reclamation Fund

### Section 101: Creation of Fund

(a) **Establishment**: There is established in the Treasury of the United States a fund to be known as the "Waste Reclamation Fund" (referred to in this Act as the "Fund").

(b) **Deposits**: The Fund shall consist of:
- (1) Waste reclamation fees collected under Section 102;
- (2) Penalties collected under Section 103;
- (3) Any appropriated amounts; and

(c) **Availability**: Amounts in the Fund shall remain available without fiscal year limitation.

### Section 102: Waste Reclamation Fee

(a) **Imposition of Fee**: Beginning January 1, 2027, a waste reclamation fee shall be imposed on manufacturers and importers for each unit of covered products sold or imported for sale in the United States.

(b) **Covered Products**: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in consultation with the Department of Commerce, shall designate products as "covered products" if they:
- (1) Are designed for single-use or limited-use purposes;
- (2) Contain materials that are non-biodegradable or persist in the environment for more than 10 years;
- (3) Are not readily recyclable using existing municipal recycling infrastructure; or
- (4) Contain hazardous substances requiring special disposal procedures.

(c) **Fee Structure**: The fee shall be calculated based on:
- (1) The material composition and volume of the product;
- (2) The environmental persistence of the materials used;
- (3) The recyclability and repairability of the product;
- (4) The presence of hazardous substances; and
- (5) The expected disposal cost borne by municipalities.

(d) **Fee Schedule**: The EPA shall establish and annually update a fee schedule, which shall:
- (1) Begin at a baseline sufficient to cover estimated end-of-life disposal costs;
- (2) Include multipliers for products containing persistent pollutants;
- (3) Include reductions for products meeting durability and recyclability standards; and
- (4) Phase in over 5 years to allow manufacturers to adjust.

(e) **Retroactive Liability**: Manufacturers of covered products shall be subject to retroactive fees for products sold since January 1, 2000, calculated at 50% of current fee rates, payable over 10 years.

### Section 103: Planned Obsolescence Penalties

(a) **Prohibition**: It shall be unlawful for any manufacturer to intentionally design, produce, or sell any covered product with planned obsolescence features.

(b) **Definition**: "Planned obsolescence" means intentional design choices that:
- (1) Artificially limit product lifespan below reasonable durability expectations;
- (2) Prevent or discourage repair through design or parts availability restrictions;

### Section 104: Material Import and Export Restrictions

(a) **Import Ban on New Materials**: Beginning January 1, 2030, the importation of virgin raw materials shall be prohibited for product categories where domestic waste streams contain sufficient reclaimed materials to meet demand, as determined by the EPA.

(b) **Waste Export Ban**: Beginning January 1, 2028, the exportation of municipal solid waste, electronic waste, plastic waste, and other materials designated by the EPA shall be prohibited.

## Legislative Intent and Framework Principles

This legislation embodies the following principles:

**Economic Justice**: Those who profit from waste-generating products must bear responsibility for the true costs of that waste, including environmental remediation and public health impacts.

**Intergenerational Responsibility**: Current generations have an obligation to cease externalizing costs onto future generations through persistent pollution and ecosystem degradation.

**Regenerative Economics**: Economic systems should restore and enhance natural systems rather than degrade them, treating waste as information about system inefficiencies rather than as unavoidable externalities.

**Indigenous Wisdom**: Traditional ecological knowledge, particularly from indigenous peoples who successfully managed resources for millennia, provides proven frameworks for sustainable human-ecosystem relationships.

**Employment Dignity**: Work that restores ecosystems and serves the collective good deserves fair compensation, benefits, and societal recognition.

**Open Knowledge**: Research funded by public dollars should be publicly accessible, enabling rapid innovation and broad implementation of solutions.

**Precautionary Principle**: When materials may cause harm to human health or the environment, the burden of proof of safety rests with those introducing those materials into commerce.

**Systems Thinking**: Interventions must consider effects across multiple scales—from individual bodies to global ecosystems—recognizing the interconnection of all life.

This Act represents a fundamental shift from an extractive economy that externalizes costs to a regenerative economy that internalizes them, creating the conditions for a thriving future for all life.
