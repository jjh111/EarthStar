Subject: Constituent Proposal: Waste Reclamation Fund Act - A Path to Economic Justice and Environmental Restoration

Dear [Representative/Senator Name],

As your constituent from San Diego, I am writing to share a legislative proposal that addresses one of our generation's most pressing challenges: the waste crisis that threatens public health, environmental systems, and our economic future. The Waste Reclamation Fund Act of 2025 (attached) offers a comprehensive framework for transforming how we handle waste—not through punishment alone, but by creating meaningful pathways toward a regenerative economy that works for everyone.

This proposal draws on proven indigenous stewardship practices, modern materials science, and economic justice principles to establish a dedicated fund for waste transformation research, ecosystem restoration, and a new category of meaningful employment: Earth Stewards. The core mechanism is simple: those who profit from waste-generating products should bear responsibility for the true costs of that waste. By internalizing these externalized costs through modest per-item fees, we can fund the transition to durable, repairable products while creating thousands of well-paying jobs in waste reclamation and ecosystem restoration. The legislation includes protections against planned obsolescence, invests in open-source research, and offers manufacturers support to transition their business models—creating economic opportunity rather than simply imposing burdens.

I believe this approach aligns with our district's values of innovation, environmental stewardship, and economic opportunity for all. I would welcome the chance to discuss this proposal with you or your staff, and I hope you will consider championing this legislation. Our communities deserve an economy that restores rather than depletes, and this Act provides a concrete roadmap for getting there.

Thank you for your service and for considering this proposal. I look forward to your response.

Sincerely,
