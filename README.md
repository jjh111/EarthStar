# Earth Star

**Regenerative Intelligence System**

A living website exploring the synthesis of ancient wisdom and autonomous systems—ten thousand years of indigenous practice meeting waste-metabolizing agents that tend rather than extract.

**Live at:** [earthstar.space](https://earthstar.space)

## What is Earth Star?

Earth Star is a regenerative intelligence framework that combines:
- Indigenous wisdom from 10,000 years of California land tending
- Autonomous "Gomen" agents designed to metabolize waste into life
- The Waste Reclamation Fund—policy mechanisms for circular economics
- Earth Steward training protocols

## The Site

The website at earthstar.space serves as the public face of the project, featuring:
- Animated parallax hero with layered imagery
- Interactive butterfly and plant-growing elements
- The core equation: `Gomens = ∑(waste × love) → TENDING → ∂regenerative_systems/∂time`

## The Prime Directive

```
∇(𝒞) ≥ 0 across ∀𝑆 ∈ {body, biome, being, network, star}
```

Coherence must increase across all five fractal scales.
