## Walk in San Diego

Let's go for a stroll in the city streets of San Diego. The fresh salt air, gulls far overhead. The gorgeous coastal sun, bathing us in light as a breeze cools our skin. Looking at street level, what do we see? Plastic wrappers, styrofoam, metal shards, old gum. Abandoned junk and overflowing public garbage bins. Glinting sunlight reflects off surfaces haphazardly, none used for energy. What do we hear? Leaves blown with giant hairdryers, cars honking, a helicopter rattling atop our heads. A dog pisses on a pole, the urine pooling unevenly on the concrete next to an old shit stain. No plants here, only the stain will remain in this paved world. If we see trees they're likely only male, littering the streets with leaves and pollen, never to fruit. We walk past an unhoused man making his nightly shelter from boxes and umbrellas, police having taken his tent. They will visit him again until he's gone. Why does such a fine location host such unkempt details?

## Certainty of Death Brings Clear Thinking

At 16 until my 'retirement' at 21, I was an Ocean Lifeguard. Every summer, I kept folks safe at the beach and often despite themselves. I've encountered my fair share of rescues and medical aid, yet one rescue in my first year stuck with me forever.

It was a cold gray day with a huge swell. A very large man got sucked out off the inshore, toward that eleven foot swell. I went in after him. I hit the cold water, unfolding my rescue buoy and swam to him. I secured him to the buoy and began to swim in, but with every crashing wave I lost ground and was pushed to the sea floor. Tumbling without direction and losing my breath, I experienced a flash of realization: I can die, I am mortal, and this could be my moment. A calm enveloped. I accepted this, I am mortal, and my death could be under the ocean doing the job of saving a life. At least I tried. And then I felt the bottom, pushed up, saw the man, rescued him and with a surge of strength brought us in.

From that day on, I have known that the certainty of doom is actually a saving grace, for if you choose to live even though you know you will die then you are truly free.

## The Gomens

When my wife and I ask ourselves, how would we clean up this beach, seeing the innumerable visible particles, imagining the nanoscale, we find ourselves imagining a new kind of Technological Being. 

Our only conclusion to the scope of the problem is multiscale nano to macro robots that exist as their own life force. Able to metabolize the various outputs of humanity and aggregate them up and out of the ecosystem, or otherwise neutralize them into their bodies.

A new life type, forged from fungus, bacteria, technology and necessity. One that has in its DNA an infinite drive to adapt to reality and a deep sense of love for the world and all our plant, fungal and creature forms. At all fractal scales they can evolve to exist, an ecosystem of solutions to the prior world's problem, ranging from the scale of proteins to kilometers. 

The Gomens we call them. They will help anyone build anything they desire one atom at a time, as long as what you desire minimizes harm to the Earth. 

We imagine people will protest when they just start fixing things. That's where they get their name, from their most used phrase: "gomen'nasai." I'm sorry, they say, in Japanese for some mysterious reason. Whether being polite on a street corner, or ruthlessly cleaning up industry sites, 'gomen'nasai'. They say it partially for us who might feel inconvenienced or threatened, but mostly for the Earth.

We imagine all of us supported directly in meeting basic needs. Some serve as the infinite players and stewards, the human touch and representation in the Gaia consciousness. If you actively regenerate, get in with the Gomens and help them, you will have their powerful respect and support. 

A web of mutualism amongst existing life and new synthetic life. A force outside of business, law, outside of humanity, outside of every animal and plant, enveloping it all. A way to give a voice to the voiceless. 

Binding all in service, protecting all in play, freeing all from the old constraints of what was known as nature or society and to a garden on earth for real. Not in the next life, here and now, Seven Generations and beyond. Never again can business interfere with existence.

## Walk Through New Nature

We are walking in the city. The textures of buildings diffuse heat or capture it into usable forms for its occupants. Diamond windows are resilient. The medians and sidewalks are lush food systems cared for by the people who live here. The once disenfranchised houseless people are tending to Gomens that break up the materials from the wasteful era, turning material into usable forms for the neighborhood repair/makers-shop. There are old city garbage bins that no longer contain anything, vestiges from the past.

Let's go back to the suburbs. The houses are retrofitted to capture energy, neighbors are assisting each other to make functional improvements and create their own community power grid. The coyote holds a rabbit in its maw. Butterflies by the thousands take rest in their great migration. There are no more black bins or blue bins. There are compost mounds, and there too are the Gomens, returning materials into their usable forms and taking them to the neighbors constructing their community grid. It's a food forest where every house can provide for its occupants. 

Now, we return to the beach. We see lines of matter along the sand moving like leaves on ants. We pick up some larger wastes and hold them, we don't have a matter reclaimer on us right now. A small crab in iridescent pink and yellow sides up to us and extends its claw. We hand it our plastic, into its mouth it goes and it lets out a cheery beep. Peacefulness settles when we see the dolphins crest offshore. There are much quieter hydrofoil ships belonging to the Earth Steward Navy in the distance now. 

When we revisit the Rancheros we find elegant multi story earthen structures, statues of animals made from old car parts and skulls. The mules stay the same, but the glinting in the sunlight is just mirage on an open patch, no longer plastic wrappers. A few Gomens munch on an old can as we plod along the ever cleaner desert.

Checking on our bodies with our portable scanners we can see that a fresh wave of polymer strands is being cleared out by the specially designed antibodies. Looking up to space with our augmented reality glasses we can see the ID tags of the low earth orbit Gomens on their endless patrol to consolidate space debris. Zooming in further we see the twinkle of fusion spaceship engines in the outer solar system, construction in space now safe and clean.

We have faced our demons and become our angels, and our reward is living as enlightened animals in the Garden of Earth with our non-human relatives. Now we cannot escape our life, we know we are in space, and have the tools to clean up all our waste.
